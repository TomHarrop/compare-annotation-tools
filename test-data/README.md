## Test datasets

- `genome.fa.gz` is part of an Arabidopsis dataset from
  [BRAKER](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER/blob/master/example/genome.fa).
  It's described
  [here](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER?tab=readme-ov-file#data-description)
  as "the last 1,000,000 nucleotides of Arabidopsis thaliana's chromosome Chr5,
  split into 8 artificial contigs".
- `RNAseq.bam` contains some reads mapped to the same genome from
  [AUGUSTUS](http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/datasets/RNAseq.bam)
